# Brawl_stars

This is a little side hobby project.
Brawl stars is a mobile phone game where the standard games are 3v3 Multiplayer Online Battle game.

This project will help users to calculate how much resources they need to power up their brawlers to maximum level.
It started on a piece of paper and I am going to turn it into a much simpler application to calculate the required resources.
